* This project has been the most challenging one so far. I look forward to updating this through this course.
* I started with the index and struggled mostly on that one. The contact and portfolio files, I didn't spend too much time on it.
* I enjoyed making this, it really felt like I was a web developer.
* Here are the contents
    * contact.html
    * index.html
    * portfolio.html
    * style.css
